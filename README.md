### Student Management System ###
This Student Management System is a web application built using Spring Boot for the backend, React for the frontend, MySQL for the database, and Bootstrap for styling. It allows the management of student information with features to add, delete, and update student details. Additionally, it supports the ability to push student results in JSON format via Postman, which are then displayed on the student's result page.
